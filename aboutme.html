    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>From a young age, I have been passionate about designing functional spaces, whether for homes or commercial environments. As I progressed in my career, my interests evolved toward leadership roles within the healthcare industry, where I aspired to make a meaningful impact by climbing the corporate ladder. In my current role as a Manager of Provider Data Quality at a regional health plan, I have overseen the development of websites and processes aimed at ensuring data governance and operational efficiency. However, the challenge of securing the necessary resources highlighted a gap in the availability of skilled web developers.</p>
    <p>Motivated to address this need, I took the initiative to learn web development through online tutorials and quickly became captivated by the craft. The blend of logic and creativity required in coding resonated deeply with me, reigniting a creative spark I hadnâ€™t felt since childhood. I discovered a newfound passion for building functional, efficient websites that can reduce human error and enhance team productivity.</p>
    <p>This journey has led me to realize that web development is not just a skill but a calling. I am committed to pursuing a career where I can leverage my technical and creative abilities to make a lasting impact, creating websites that drive efficiency and innovation. This is the work I am passionate about and where I see my future.</p>
